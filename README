# Arkham

As an interpreter Arkham's goal is to provide fine grained control over the evaluation of a language.

Arkham is written so that the language it interprets follows Clojure's semantics as far as posible.

## Usage

where you would use eval use evil

if you want to change the constructor behaviour for a certain class:

(defmethod ctor Thread [& _]
  (throw (Exception. "DENIED")))

;;=> (evil '(Thread.))
;; #<Exception java.lang.Exception: DENIED>

change the behaviour of method invocation:

(defmethod dot [clojure.lang.Var 'invoke] [& _]
  (throw (Exception. "DENIED")))

;;=> (evil '(.invoke #'+ 1 2))
;; #<Exception java.lang.Exception: DENIED>

change var resolution:

(defmethod get-var #'clojure.core/eval [_ _]  #'arkham.core/evil)

;;=> (evil '#'clojure.core/eval)
;; #'arkham.core/evil
;;=> (evil 'clojure.core/eval)
;; #<core$evil arkham.core$evil@43748549>

*STACK* is replaced with the current stack:

;;=> (evil '(let [x 1 y 2] (loop [x (range 10)] *STACK*)))
;; ({x (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)} #loop {x 1 y 2})

#loop is a special marker on the stack used by recur
